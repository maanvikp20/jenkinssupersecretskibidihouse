      <p>What lies in the puzzle will be the key</p>

      <p>
        Lo! In the mist of the night, where the moon doth glint over the
        darkened wood, a brave knight embraceth his shield and draws his sword.
        Every stream whispers its secrets, a nymph silently watcheth the
        struggle of mortals. Lo! Day bringeth light on the fields, as the dragon
        evers its dark nest, a warning to all who dare approach.
