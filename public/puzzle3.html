    <h3>Puzzle 3</h3>
    <p>
      One must needs know the storied past of the founders of our most
      clandestine order — the hallowed Jenkins Secret Society. Yet, to prove thy
      wit and earn passage deeper within, thou must first answer this riddle
      most cunning.
    </p>
    <p>Lo, the question be thus:</p>
    <p>David’s sire hath three sons — Snap, Crackle, and _____?</p>
    <p>
      Think well, traveler, for the answer lieth not in the noise of names, but
      in the quiet truth before thine eyes.
