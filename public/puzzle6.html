    <h3>Puzzle 6</h3>
    
    <p>
      Harken upon thee! How many dawgs may one noble hound possess, if a single dog be
      blessed with four paws, yet there exist thirteen dogs, each bearing their
      own brood of doggy babes? Verily, each proud mother of fur hath fifteen
      such babes, each babe adorned with four paws, and thus they beget a
      multitude of dawgs indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But lo! Each solitary dawg bringeth forth five dawglets, lively and small.
      And each dawglet, by fate’s design, hath threescore and four prints upon
      the earth. Yet every print, as if touched by the divine, reacheth into the
      boundless void and calleth forth the might of the Dawg God of Dawgs, who
      blesseth each print with two fair printlets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, by paw and by dawg, by dawglet and by print divine, the world
      overfloweth with printlets beyond mortal reckoning. Tell me, gentle
      scholar — canst thou number them?
