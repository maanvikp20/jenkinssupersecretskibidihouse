    <h3>Puzzle 6</h3>

    <div class="puzzle-container">
      <p>
        Harken upon thee! How many dawgs may one noble hound possess, if a
        single dog be blessed with four paws, yet there exist thirteen dogs,
        each bearing their own brood of doggy babes? Verily, each proud mother
        of fur hath fifteen such babes, each babe adorned with four paws, and
        thus they beget a multitude of dawgs indeed.
      </p>

      <p>
        But lo! Each solitary dawg bringeth forth five dawglets, lively and
        small. And each dawglet, by fateâ€™s design, hath threescore and four
        prints upon the earth. Yet every print, as if touched by the divine,
        reacheth into the boundless void and calleth forth the might of the Dawg
        God of Dawgs, who blesseth each print with two fair printlets.
      </p>

      <p>
        Therefore, by paw and by dawg, by dawglet and by print divine, the world
        overfloweth with printlets beyond mortal reckoning. Tell me, gentle
        scholar â€” canst thou number them?
      </p>

      <div class="hint-box">
        ðŸ’¡ <strong>Hint:</strong> Break the problem into steps. Count paws, then
        puppies, then prints, then multiply by two for the final answer.
